# MicroJava Compiler

Transforms MicroJava programs into executable bytecode for a custom VM.



---



# Description

This project is a fully functional compiler for the MicroJava programming language. It translates MicroJava source code into bytecode that can be executed on a custom MicroJava virtual machine. The compiler implements all compilation phases, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. This project helped me understand the full compilation process, low-level memory management, and debugging techniques, while strengthening problem-solving skills in both assembly and high-level languages.

Lexical Analysis – Reads source code and converts it into tokens.

Syntax Analysis – Checks code structure and builds parse trees.

Semantic Analysis – Ensures correct use of variables, types, and scope.

Code Generation – Converts MicroJava code into executable bytecode.

Virtual Machine Execution – Runs bytecode on a custom MicroJava VM.
